# Development Environment for WSL  

### Background  
I prefer doing development on a Linux-based system, but I also use my Windows laptop for gaming and general tasks. Recently, my development machine broke, and I didnâ€™t want to clutter my Windows installation with numerous applicationsâ€”some of which I might only use once (looking at you, *Tesseract* ðŸ˜…).  

### The Solution: WSL  
To get the best of both worlds, I turned to **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**. Initially, I installed a base OS and used it as needed, but then I realized that if I ever needed to start fresh, Iâ€™d have to reinstall everything manually. So, I decided to create a **custom WSL image** to streamline the process.

### How to Use It  

1. **Request access to the image:** [Download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10L7b8TlB9bPLyL7ieB9VP3Pz-4diX45Q/view?usp=drive_link).  
2. **Import the image into WSL:**  
   ```sh
   wsl --import DevPower <Path-to-storage> <Path-to-downloaded-image>
   ```
3. **Login credentials:**  
   - **Username:** `dev_power`  
   - **Password:** `dev_power`
